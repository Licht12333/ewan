                    <h1>WHAT IS EARTH</h1>
                    <P>Earth is our home planet.<br>Scientists believe Earth and its moon formed around the same time as the rest of the solar system.<br>They think that was about 4.5 billion years ago.<br>Earth is the fifth-largest planet in the solar system.<br>Its diameter is about 8,000 miles.<br>And Earth is the third-closest planet to the sun.<br>Its average distance from the sun is about 93 million miles.<br>Only Mercury and Venus are closer.<br>
                        Earth has been called the "Goldilocks planet."<br>In the story of "Goldilocks and the Three Bears," a little girl named Goldilocks liked everything just right.<br>Her porridge couldn't be too hot or too cold.<br>And her bed couldn't be too hard or too soft.<br>On Earth, everything is just right for life to exist.<br>It's warm, but not too warm.<br>And it has water, but not too much water.<br>                        
                        Earth is the only planet known to have large amounts of liquid water.<br>Liquid water is essential for life.<br>Earth is the only planet where life is known to exist.</P>
